# Scholarly Network Analysis on Codd's World (The Database Community Publication Graph)
# Synopsis
Scholarly Network Analysis (SNA) is the study of a scientific research networks aiming to discover meaningful insights helpful to the research community to make data-driven research decisions. Analyzing these networks has become increasingly challenging due to the amount of scientific research being added daily, in addition to information being collected from more online sources (e.g. academic social platforms), making the network larger and more complex. Our work aims to present an early study on a specific network: the database community publication graph,  Codd's World. We specifically analyze the topics of the published papers, the relevance of authors and papers, and how this relates to raw publication counts. This work mainly demonstrates how Topic Modeling can be a useful entry point for SNA.
# Motivation
This analytical study is inspired by Prof. Dr. Erhard Rahm and Prof. Dr. Andreas Thor work on Citation analysis of database publications [1] and Prof. Dr. Erhard Rahm and David Aumüller work on Affiliation analysis of database publications [2].
